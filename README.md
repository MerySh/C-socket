Open root directory of the project.
	1. run command <make> 
	2. open new terminal from root directory and run command 
		<./server (port) <1111> >
	3. open another terminal from root directory and try to connect to socket with command
		<./client (port but the same as server port otherwise will return error (validation for active port))>

Have fun.
